Home Page:

prompt to greet user

input:
user types journal
user chooses tag from dropdown
user submits

journal/tag received from front end
create JSON obj var using journal string and tag string

send/store JOSN obj to db/textfile

if tag = xyz then recommendation
	

output:
prompt recommendation based on tag


Simplified MVP - tags-to-recommendation is hardcoded in the same javascript

1) user types journal text
2) user chooses tag from dropdwon
3) user submit

4) tag string received from front end
5) get recommendation - check json mapping for recommendation (recommendation = tagMapping[tagValue])
6) send recommendation to front end

7) display recommendation to user

Had to write the front end in Java script and didnot wat to have to code in multiple languages
